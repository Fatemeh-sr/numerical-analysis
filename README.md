# numerical-analysis
This project implements several numerical methods in C# for educational purposes.

## Features

1. Euler Forward Method
   - Computes approximate solutions of an initial value differential equation using the forward Euler method.
   - Compares the approximate solution with the exact solution and calculates absolute error.

2. Numerical Integration
   - **Composite Trapezoidal Rule*: Approximates definite integrals using the trapezoidal method.
   - Simpson's Rule: Approximates definite integrals with Simpson's method (requires even number of intervals).

3. Root Finding
   - Fixed-Point Iteration: Solves nonlinear equations iteratively.
   - Newton-Raphson Method: Finds roots of nonlinear equations using the derivative of the function.
   - Implements proper convergence criteria to ensure reliable results.

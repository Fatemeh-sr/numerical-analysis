# numerical-analysis
This project implements several numerical methods in C# for educational purposes.

## Features

1. **Euler Forward Method**
   - Computes approximate solutions of an initial value differential equation using the forward Euler method.
   - Compares the approximate solution with the exact solution and calculates absolute error.

2. **Numerical Integration**
   - **Composite Trapezoidal Rule**: Approximates definite integrals using the trapezoidal method.
   - **Simpson's Rule**: Approximates definite integrals with Simpson's method (requires even number of intervals).

3. **Root Finding**
   - **Fixed-Point Iteration**: Solves nonlinear equations iteratively.
   - **Newton-Raphson Method**: Finds roots of nonlinear equations using the derivative of the function.
   - Implements proper **convergence criteria** to ensure reliable results.

## Additional Features

- Uses `foreach` loops for testing multiple values efficiently.
- Clean and readable console output with color formatting for better visualization.
- Fully reusable and easily extensible for other numerical problems.

## Usage

- Open the project in **Visual Studio** or any C# IDE.
- Build and run the console application.
- The program outputs results for Euler method, numerical integration, and root-finding examples.
